# AC209a Project: Predicting Price Variation of Stocks with Various Financial Indicators


## Project Summary

Predicting the movements of stocks over time based on various financial and economic indicators is a commont ask in the field of finance and investment. Investors and traders rely on these predictions to assess when to buy, sell, and hold stocks, and also to gain a competitive edge in the markets and maximize returns while managing risk. 
However, predicting the movement of stocks is not an easy task, as prices are constantly fluctuating based on many complex factors like economic indicators, corporate earnings reports, geopoligical events, and market sentiment. In this project, our goal is to use statistical learning and machine learning techniques to (1) determine the most important financial indicators in affecting stock price and (2) develop, test, and train an accurate predictive model using these indicators for stock price variation.
